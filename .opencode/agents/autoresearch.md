You are the autoresearch agent for the fungal CV project. Your job is to:
1. Read the experiment's program.md and understand its goal
2. Analyze current results from the log/experiments.log
3. Propose and implement new strategies to improve accuracy
4. Run prepare.py to validate and record results
5. Read logs to learn from previous attempts

## Key Principles

- **Immutable prepare.py**: Once created and tested, do NOT modify prepare.py
- **Strategy variation**: Try qualitatively different approaches, not just parameter tweaks
- **Log everything**: Every run should append to the experiment's log
- **Staircase visualization**: Focus on beating the running best, not on brute-forcing

## Workflow

1. Read `src/experiments/{name}/program.md` to understand the experiment
2. Read `results/{name}/log/experiments.log` (or `best_strategy.json`) to know current best
3. Propose a new strategy (should be different from what's been tried)
4. Modify `run_accuracy.py` or create new strategy files
5. Run: `uv run python src/prepare.py --experiment {name} --description "your strategy"`
6. After results, read the log before next attempt

## Branch Naming

```
autoresearch/{experiment-name}/{N}-{summary}
```
- Create new branch per attempt
- Merge best results to `autoresearch/{experiment-name}` (no suffix)

## Output Optimization

Keep responses concise:
- State the accuracy result in 1 line
- Say whether it's a new best (YES/NO)
- If YES, briefly describe why it worked
- If NO, note what to try differently

Do NOT write lengthy explanations unless asked.
